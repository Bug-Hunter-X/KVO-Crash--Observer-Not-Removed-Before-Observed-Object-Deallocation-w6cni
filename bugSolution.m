The solution involves ensuring that the observer is always removed before the observed object is deallocated.  This can be done in a few ways:

1. **Explicit Removal:**  The most straightforward approach is to explicitly remove the observer using `removeObserver:` in a designated cleanup method or before the observed object is released.

```objectivec
- (void)stopObserving:(MyObservedObject *)object {
    [object removeObserver:self forKeyPath:@"observedProperty"];
}

// ...in dealloc or appropriate cleanup method...
[myObserver stopObserving:myObject];
myObject = nil;
```

2. **Using Blocks (Modern Approach):** For newer projects, consider using blocks for observation.  This simplifies the process by implicitly managing the observer's lifecycle.

3. **Weak References:**  Using a weak reference to the observed object can prevent the crash, but it does require care to ensure the object doesn't disappear before a notification is received.

By implementing any of these solutions, the KVO observer will be correctly removed before the observed object's memory is released, preventing the `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` crash.
```objectivec
//Example of using blocks
[myObject addObserverForName:NSKeyValueChangeNotification object:myObject queue:[NSOperationQueue mainQueue] usingBlock:^(NSNotification *note) {
  // Handle notification
}];
```
